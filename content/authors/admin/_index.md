I am a postdoc reseracher in the Department of Electronics and Informatics at Vrije Universiteit Brussel. Before this, I worked as a postdoc researcher in the Department of Computer and Information Sciences at Northumbria University, and a visiting scholar in the School of Informatics at Edinburgh University. I have sucessfully supervised 1 master student, and now I am surpervising 2 PhD students and 3 master students. I have contributed to more than 20 research papers on the journals including IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, Neural Networks, The Visual Computer, Electronics Letters, Textile Research Journal, International Journal of Clothing Science and Technology, and Journal of Engineered Fibers and Fabrics in the fields of machine learning, computer graphics, and computer vision.
